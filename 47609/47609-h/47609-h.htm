<h4>WHAT HAPPENED TO HENNY PENNY.</h4>

<hr class="narrow" />

<p>H. P.&mdash;Oh dear me! Oh dear me! What was
it, I wonder? What could it have been? I must
scream for help. Help! Help!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Cockie Lockie</span>.</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;What's the matter? Henny Penny, what
is happening?</p>

<p>H. P.&mdash;Oh dear me! I don't know what it was,
that is the worst of it.</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;You don't know what it was?</p>

<p>H. P.&mdash;How should I, when I never saw it? It
fell on to my head.</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;<i>What</i> fell on to your head? What a stupid
hen you are!</p>

<p>H. P.&mdash;I was under a beanstack pecking about,
and suddenly something fell from the top of the
stack on to my head. I thought at first it was a
bean or a piece of stick, but now I think of it, I am
sure it was something much heavier&mdash;a piece of the
sky, or something of that sort.</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;A piece of the sky falling out! But,
Henny, this is serious.</p>

<p>H. P.&mdash;Of course! That's what I feel. That's
why I screamed at once for help.</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;You see, if the sky is coming to bits, I
think the Queen of England ought to know it.</p>

<p>H. P.&mdash;I think she ought. Let's go and tell her!</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;Agreed! We'll start at once. I'll just
crow first very loud that everybody may know
something is happening.</p>

<p>H. P.&mdash;Very well, and I'll cluck.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>They crow and cluck.</i>)</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;Now, then, we can start.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>A voice outside is heard.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Voice.</span>&mdash;Hullo there! Cockie Lockie! Henny
Penny!</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;There's that stupid Ducky Daddles.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Ducky Daddles</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>C. L.&mdash;Well, Ducky Daddles, what do you want?</p>

<p>D. D.&mdash;I just wanted to come and have a chat.
I saw you and Henny Penny starting off for a
pleasant walk together, and I thought I'd come
too.</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;Ah! but this is no common walk.</p>

<p>H. P.&mdash;Indeed it is not.</p>

<p>D. D.&mdash;Why, where are you going to?</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;We're going to London to see the
Queen.</p>

<p>D. D.&mdash;The Queen! What for?</p>

<p>H. P.&mdash;To tell her a most important piece of
news.</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;A great piece of the sky fell out close to
Henny Penny's head, and nearly killed her.</p>

<p>D. D.&mdash;Dear me! That is important. The
Queen ought to know it at once. I'll come with
you.</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;You! Do you think you can walk so
far?</p>

<p>D. D.&mdash;Oh, dear, yes! Besides, I daresay, we
shall find some place on the road where we can get
slugs or snails, or something of that sort, in case I
feel faint.</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;Very well, then, are you ready? Now
we'll start.</p>

<p>D. D.&mdash;Come on, then. I'll just quack first to
let people know where I am.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="revind">(<i>Quacks. They prepare to start off arm in arm.
A voice outside is heard.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Voice.</span>&mdash;Hullo! Cockie Lockie! Henny Penny!
Ducky Daddles!</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;Now, what is it? We shall never get off
at this rate.</p>

<p>D. D.&mdash;It is that silly Goosey Poosey.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Goosey Poosey</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>G. P.&mdash;There you are, Ducky Daddles! I've
been looking for you everywhere!</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;What do you want?</p>

<p>G. P.&mdash;I just wanted to see what you were
doing, and have a chat. What a horrid day it is!
the roads are so dry there is no walking in them.</p>

<p>D. D.&mdash;Well, I am sorry I've not time to stay
with you. I'm just off to London to see the
Queen.</p>

<p>G. P.&mdash;You, Ducky Daddles! Something very
strange must have happened to make you go so
far.</p>

<p>D. D.&mdash;Indeed it has, and what do you think?</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;Guess what fell on to Henny Penny's
head.</p>

<p>G. P.&mdash;An acorn, or perhaps even a chestnut.</p>

<p>D. D.&mdash;A chestnut! Oh, if that were all! No,
my friend. It was a piece of the sky, a great, solid
slab of blue sky, that fell <i>clump</i> on to the top of
poor Henny Penny's head, and nearly killed her.</p>

<p>G. P.&mdash;Oh, how terrible! Have you sent for the
police?</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;No, we're going to London to tell the
Queen. We think she ought to know.</p>

<p>G. P.&mdash;Indeed she ought, and at once. I'll come
with you to see what she says.</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;Very well! Only you must not keep
waiting to splash about in all the puddles, then.</p>

<p>G. P.&mdash;Of course not, when I'm out walking on
business.</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;Very well, then, we'll start without losing
any more time.</p>

<p>G. P.&mdash;I'll just hiss first in case there's an enemy
in the road. (<i>Hisses.</i>) Now, then, I'm ready.</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;Then let us start.</p>

most serious.</p>

<p>T. L.&mdash;You make my feathers stand on end.
What <i>is</i> the matter?</p>

<p>G. P.&mdash;Haven't you heard? The most terrible
thing has happened!</p>

<p>H. P.&mdash;One half of the sky fell on me as I was
sitting under a haystack, and we don't know what
is going to happen next.</p>

<p>T. L.&mdash;Oh dear! This <i>is</i> terrible! Suppose the
other half were to come down?</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;Exactly! That's what we're afraid of.
We're going to the Queen of England to see what
she can do.</p>

<p>T. L.&mdash;A very good thing to do! I'll come with
you and explain it all to her. Oho!</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;Are you sure you're not too fat to walk
so far?</p>

<p>T. L.&mdash;Too fat! Aha! On the contrary, I shall
make you look respectable. We shall be admitted
to the Queen at once. I'll just gobble first to let
her know we're coming.</p>

going to London on most serious business.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. F.</span>&mdash;To London?</p>

<p>G. P.&mdash;Yes, indeed! The whole sky has got
loose and is slipping about in the most dangerous
manner.</p>

<p>D. D.&mdash;It would have killed Henny Penny if she
hadn't got under a beanstack.</p>

<p>D. D.&mdash;Are you, indeed!</p>

London, that will get you there in less than half
the time.</p>

<p>C. L.&mdash;Oh, then, pray show it to us. Every
minute is precious.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. F.</span>&mdash;You can't possibly mistake the road.
Directly you get out of here, you will see a dark
path to the right, that looks rather like the entrance
to a cavern. However, you may be sure it
leads to London, and you'll find the Queen sitting
at the other end of it.</p>

<p>T. L.&mdash;Ah! that's capital! Oho! Aha! Hurrah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. F.</span>&mdash;You all go on in front, and I'll bring up
the rear, in case a lion comes up behind us.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. R.</span>&mdash;(<i>Obliged to shout.</i>) It seems&mdash;there has
been some difficulty&mdash;about the hall.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;About the hall&mdash;yes. (<i>Looking round
at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Petsy</span>.) She is such a merry child, it makes
one quite happy to see her!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. R.</span>&mdash;(<i>Aside.</i>) I am glad it has that effect
upon some one!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;You were saying about the hall&mdash;</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Ma! Mamma!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;Yes, darling, yes. About the hall&mdash;</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Ma! Ma! Ma!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;I don't know why there should be any
difficulty&mdash;</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Ma! Ma!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;What is it, my dear one? What do
you want?</p>

<p>P.&mdash;May I play with the silver inkstand?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;If you'll take great care of it, yes.
(<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps"><ins title="original has Mrs. S.">Mrs. R.</ins></span>) Did you ever hear such ideas as the

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. R.</span>&mdash;(<i>Aside.</i>) Well, perhaps now she's got
the inkstand she'll be quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;You have no idea what quaint things
she says sometimes. You must get me to tell you
some of them next time we meet.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;(<i>Goes up to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Roberts</span> <i>and pulls her cloak</i>.)
Why do you wear this ugly cloak?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;Oh, really, Petsy! I don't know what
Mrs. Roberts will think! Such a pretty cloak,
too.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;No, it isn't. It's hideous, and so is her
bonnet. It's like Miss Jane's cloak in the poem.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. R.</span>&mdash;In the poem?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;Yes, that's a little poem she has learnt.
You can't think what a memory she has for that
kind of thing. I should like you to hear her recite
it. You can't think how prettily she does it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. R.</span>&mdash;Does she, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;Petsy, will you say your poetry to Mrs.
Roberts?</p>

<p>P.&mdash;No, I shan't.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;Oh, now do! Mrs. Roberts would like
it so much, wouldn't you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. R.</span>&mdash;Oh, of all things.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;She's so unexpected, isn't she? (<i>To</i>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. R.</span>&mdash;(<i>Horrified.</i>) The violin!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;Yes, she does show such talent!

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. R.</span>&mdash;(<i>Aside.</i>) Yes, I shall be quite surprised
if she does.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;Of course, it's a little squeaky at times&mdash;but,
after all, she's such a child, it's a wonder she
plays at all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. R.</span>&mdash;It is indeed. (<i>Aside.</i>) Especially to

about that hall.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;Ah, to be sure, the hall, yes&mdash;we've

about the bazaar, won't you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. S.</span>&mdash;Oh, of course, I will, and then you
must come here that we may have a good talk and

sing her song, and dance her dance! she dances
like a fairy, I assure you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Eleanor.</span>&mdash;(<i>Calling outside.</i>) Walter! Walter!
(<i>Running in.</i>) Here you are, at last! Do come
and play in the garden!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Walter.</span>&mdash;(<i>Who is walking about with a book.</i>)
Certainly not! Don't you see I am deep in study?</p>

<p>E.&mdash;But it's play-time.</p>

<p>W.&mdash;I dislike play-time.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;What a dull creature! Do you mean to say
that you never play?</p>

<p>W.&mdash;As seldom as possible.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;What a pity! I have just got some new
reins, and I wanted to play at horses. I do love
being a horse.</p>

<p>W.&mdash;That is a natural preference. The horse
has ever been a favoured companion of man. It
is even on record that the Roman Emperor,
Caligula<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>E.&mdash;I will not talk about Roman Emperors during
play-time. Come along, I will drag the cart
and you shall drive standing up, if you like, as they
do at the circus.</p>

<p>W.&mdash;That is a custom which dates from the most
remote antiquity. Pictorial representations of
standing charioteers are found on the Assyrian
friezes and the Egyptian tombs<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>E.&mdash;(<i>Stopping her ears.</i>) I <i>will not</i> talk about the
Egyptians during play-time. Come, will you drive
the cart?</p>

<p>W.&mdash;Certainly not.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Then shall we skip? Look, I have a new
skipping-rope, which my father gave me last week.</p>

<p>W.&mdash;The hemp from which that rope was made
was doubtless derived from the flax grown in the
province of Ulster, in Ireland, especially in the
county of Antrim, of which the principal towns are
Belfast, Lisbon, and Carrickfergus.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Oh, bother the county of Antrim and the
province of Ulster! I don't care to know where
the skipping-rope grew. I want to skip with it.</p>

<p>W.&mdash;That is quite a savage instinct; the remarkable
agility of the South Sea Islanders<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>E.&mdash;I won't talk of the South Sea Islanders
during play-time. You won't skip, then?</p>

<p>W.&mdash;Certainly not.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Then let's be soldiers. I love playing at
soldiers.</p>

<p>W.&mdash;That is somewhat of an unfeminine instinct,
although it is justified by more than one example
in history. Thus, Boadicea<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>E.&mdash;Oh, shut up, or I will run you through with
my sword! It's just like a real one. It's made of
the most beautiful steel.</p>

<p>W.&mdash;Then the blade probably came from the
district of Cleveland in Yorkshire, where the iron
and steel industries may be seen in their greatest
development. You have, doubtless, heard of the
steel works of Eston, and the blast furnaces of
Middlesborough?</p>

<p>E.&mdash;I don't know what a blast furnace is.</p>

<p>W.&mdash;Allow me to describe that ingenious construction
to you.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;No, thank you, not in my play-time. I am
going to get some daisies to make a daisy-chain.</p>

<p>W.&mdash;You doubtless have a herbarium?</p>

<p>E.&mdash;No. I don't believe they grow in this
garden.</p>

<p>W.&mdash;Oh, too ignorant girl! A herbarium is not
a flower, it is a collection of dried flowers and
plants.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Ah, well! I haven't one then.</p>

<p>W.&mdash;That is a mistake. You should carefully
dry the plants and stick them in a book, with a
minute description of each specimen written on the
opposite page.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;I can't stick anything in a book, because
Mamma doesn't like me to use her gum, and I have
only fish-glue.</p>

<p>W.&mdash;Fish-glue is, for certain purposes, a most
valuable substance. It has even been known to
cure cecity or blindness. Thus, Tobit<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>E.&mdash;Don't talk about Tobit. Are you coming to
make a daisy-chain?</p>

<p>W.&mdash;Never.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Shall we play at battledore? I have a heavy
shuttlecock and a light one, whichever you like
best.</p>

<p>W.&mdash;That is because the density of cork varies
in a very marked manner. That brought from
the West Indies<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>E.&mdash;Don't talk about the West Indies during
play-time. Are you coming to play at battledore?</p>

<p>W.&mdash;On no account.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Very well, then, you may stay with your
Egyptians, your South Sea Islanders, and your
West Indies, while I go and play in the garden. I
think you are rather a prig. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p>W.&mdash;(<i>Looking after her, surprised.</i>) A prig! How
odd! I wonder what makes her say that?</p>

<h4>CAT AND DOG.</h4>
<hr class="narrow" />

<p><span class="smallcaps">Towser.</span>&mdash;What a night! I am tied up in the
yard, and told to bark if I hear a noise. Suddenly
I hear a screeching and pecking in the poultry-yard,
fowls flapping about in all directions. Of course I
bark as loud as I can, my master comes out to
see what it is about, he finds one of the hens
missing, and beats me as if I had killed it. I
do call that hard on a steady, respectable dog
like me.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pussy</span> <i>without seeing</i> <span class="smallcaps">Towser</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pussy.</span>&mdash;Well, I do call it hard! Everything
that is broken in the house, they say is done by
the cat. Now, this morning, again, a beautiful
Venetian looking-glass is broken, and so my mistress
would not give me a saucer of cream for breakfast.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;(<i>Seeing</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pussy</span>.) Bow! Wow!</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Mew! Mew!</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Good-morning, Mistress Pussy.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Good-morning, Mr. Towser. I hope you're
well.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;I am very tired. I had to bark a great deal
in the night.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Really! I am sorry to hear that. You
must do as I do, come and sleep on the hearth-rug
during the day.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;I only wish I could, but I am much too busy
a dog for that.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Are you? What do you do all day?</p>

<p>T.&mdash;First of all, I have to be ready to bite the
postman's legs when he comes at eight, and then
to bark at him as he goes across the road.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;It must be difficult to bark&mdash;I am sure I
should never manage it.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;It is very difficult indeed&mdash;I am the only
person in the house that can manage it. Then
when the postman has gone, I go into the kitchen
to help the cook to get rid of the bones and scraps
that are left.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;The worst of bones is, they are so dreadfully
hard. I much prefer a saucer of milk, or a fish's
tail. Oh how delicious that is!</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Oh, I couldn't touch a fish's tail. Then when
my master is at breakfast, I have to beg, and that
is very hard work, as I am on my legs all the time,
balancing things on my nose.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;If I were you, I would arch my back instead,
and rub myself against the master's legs.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Of course I could arch my back if I wanted
to do so, but I don't care to. Then after breakfast,
I have a few minutes' rest before the fire.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Oh, isn't that comfortable! Rolled round in
a basket. It is so nice to purr a little, and then
gradually go off to sleep.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;To tell the truth, I don't care to purr, I think
it is so stupid. One might as well be a kettle or a
bumble bee at once. What I like to do is to come
and scratch at the door, just after it has been shut,
to smell round the rug, to turn round two or three
times, and then lie down quietly.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;To curl round with one's head nestled in
between one's fore-paws.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Oh, I like to sleep with my paws straight
out.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;The result is, you don't sleep nearly so long.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Because I haven't time. Then when my
mistress goes out driving, I have to bark at the
pony when he starts. And I have to go out with
the carriage, and pay visits, and I jump upon strange
people's laps, and make their dresses all muddy in
front.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;That must be delightful! But I shouldn't
care to go with the carriage, I would rather stay at
home and enjoy myself, and scratch the visitors
who come here. By the way, can you draw in your
claws?</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Draw them in! Certainly not.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;You don't mean to say you can't do such a
simple thing as that?</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Of course I could if I liked, but I don't
choose. I think you ought to make up your
mind either to have claws, or not to have them:
not to be popping them in and out as you do.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;But it's so convenient when I walk about at
night, to be able to steal about gently and then
shoot out my claws when I see a mouse.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Oh, how tempting that sounds! Then it's
always at night you hunt?</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Oh, always. There is no one to see or to
disturb you.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Exactly. Now, when I go out with my
master, if I go after a hen or a rabbit, I am beaten
at once.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Fancy being beaten for a hen!</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Isn't it absurd! Just for an idiotic bird like
that!</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Who can't lap, or scratch!</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Nor bark, nor do anything!</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Never mind. I killed one last night, I am
glad to say.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;You killed a hen?</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Certainly.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Well, I do call that hard on me! My
master beat me as hard as he could because of that
hen.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Well! Were you beaten for that wretched,
tough old hen? That <i>is</i> funny!</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Yes, that is a good joke, madam, I dare say!
But we shall see.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Don't be angry about such a trifle.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;I will be revenged still more. I have already
broken a Venetian looking-glass, to show my indignation.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Was it you who broke the looking-glass?</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Certainly it was.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Then we are quits. My mistress insisted
that I had broken it, and would not give me my
saucer of cream.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Oh, that really is funny! We are quits, then.
Shall we be friends again?</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Certainly, if you like.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;And, as a proof of our friendship, next time
you come to kill the hens, I won't bark.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;That's a bargain. I'll steal two more to-night,
and give you one.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Oh, what a good plan! Let's go and choose
them.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Two nice fat ones!</p>

<hr class="narrow" />

<p><span class="smallcaps">Elsie.</span>&mdash;Isn't it delightful that Fanny is coming
from London to spend the day with us.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span>&mdash;Indeed it is. We must show her everything
as soon as she comes.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Yes, directly&mdash;and the first thing must be
the wigwam.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Of course it must, and we will tell her all
about it, and that it is our own hut in the garden
that we have arranged ourselves.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Or shall we make her guess who made it?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Oh yes! That would be lovely! We will
take her there, and tell her to shut her eyes quite
tight.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Then she won't be able to see the wigwam.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;No, that's true. Then she must have them
shut all the way through the garden.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;And when she gets there, we will say: "Open
your eyes, and guess whose wigwam this is".</p>

<p>M.&mdash;And, when she has guessed that, we will say:
"Now guess who painted it".</p>

<p>E.&mdash;And, when she has guessed that, we will say:
"Now guess who furnished it".</p>

<p>M.&mdash;And, when she has guessed that, we'll say:
"Guess who papered it".</p>

<p>E.&mdash;She'll be rather stupid if she does not guess
that time whose it is.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;But, you know, little girls from London are
very often stupid, when they come into the country.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;That's true. Do you remember when Amy
came, she did not know the difference between a
goose and a duck?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;And she was afraid of the turkey-cock!</p>

<p>E.&mdash;And she looked at an oak, and said how very
small the chestnuts were!</p>

<p>M.&mdash;There's the door-bell. There they are!
Now, mind, I am the eldest, so I shall say: "Now,
I am going to show you the wigwam" as soon as she
comes in.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Before we shake hands?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;No! no! After we shake hands.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;I think I ought to say it too, you know.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;It would be absurd both saying it together,
she won't understand.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Oh, yes! she will, if we say it loud and
slowly, like this, now then you say it with me
(<i>both together</i>): We-are-going-to-show-you-the-wigwam!!</p>

<p>F.&mdash;What's that? I hate insects.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;It isn't an insect! it's a hut in the garden.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;That's not so bad. Dear me! how tired I
am. (<i>Looks round for a chair.</i>)</p>

much?</p>

<p>F.&mdash;Why, we walked all the way from the
station.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;The station! Why, it's barely five minutes
from here.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;I don't care how long it is, it tired me all
the same.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;We'll go to the wigwam when you are rested.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;How far is it?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Just across the garden, on the other side of
the lawn.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;If I walk across the grass I shall get my feet
wet.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Then we'll go by the gravel walk, it's only a
few seconds longer.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;If I walk on the gravel I shall spoil my kid
boots.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;You ought to have strong boots like ours for
the country.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;I can't bear those clumsy boots!</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Then how are you going to get to the wigwam?</p>

<p>F.&mdash;Why should we go there at all?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Because we wanted to show it to you.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;Why?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;We want you to guess who furnished it.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;The carpenter, I suppose, or the upholsterer,
or whoever does those things.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;No, we did it.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;You!</p>

<p>M.&mdash;We papered and painted it all ourselves.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;Oh how disgusting!</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Disgusting! it was delightful. We did it
with paste and with Aspinall.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;I love Aspinall.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;I don't. I hate having paint on my fingers.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;And the paste is quite clean&mdash;it's only flour
and water.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;Flour and water! Ugh! I can't bear
things that make one's fingers sticky.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;After all, it is very easy to wash off.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;I don't like to wash my hands too often, it
spoils my skin.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Besides, of course, <i>you</i> need not touch either
the paste or the paint.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;What shall I do then?</p>

<p>E.&mdash;You shall sit down and look round you.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;Sit on what?</p>

<p>E.&mdash;On an old packing-case covered with chintz!
You have no idea what a comfortable seat it makes.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;A packing-case! I am sure there would be
nails in it that would catch on my dress. I would
rather sit in the house on a proper chair.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;But you surely don't want to stay in all day,
when the sun is shining like this?</p>

<p>F.&mdash;That's just it, I don't like to sit in the sun.
I shall get freckled.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Do you like to be out in the damp, then?</p>

<p>F.&mdash;Oh no, indeed! It takes the curl out of my
hair.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;What shall we do, then? It's so dull sitting
in here.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;Very! but I knew before I came it would be
dull.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;(<i>Aside.</i>) Isn't she rude!</p>

<p>E.&mdash;(<i>Aside.</i>) Hush! (<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Fanny</span>.) I'll tell you
what we will do. We'll go into the poultry-yard,
it is shady there.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;Well, what is there to see in the poultry-yard?</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Oh, all sorts of things. We can look for
eggs and bring in some for breakfast.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;I think the servants ought to do that.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Or we can feed the hens.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;I wouldn't for worlds! I hate things that
come flapping and pecking round my feet.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Then let's go into the stable and we will
show you our ponies.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;Oh, no! Stables are so smelly, I can't bear
them.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;Well, is there anything you would like to
do? What do you do in London?</p>

<p>F.&mdash;I like driving through the streets in an open
carriage and looking at the shops.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;In that case, you had better have remained
in London, as there are no streets here and no
shops.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;Very well! I shall go and tell my mother
that I want to go back.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Well, mother, how are you?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;I was getting anxious about you. Where

<p>J.&mdash;Oh, I've been seeing the neighbours.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;I thought as much. Which neighbours?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;First I went to see Father Clumpylump.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Indeed! Father Clumpylump! Honest
man! And what did he say to you?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;He gave me a needle for a present.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;A most useful present! Where is it?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I stuck it into a bundle of hay that was
standing in a cart, and then I could not find it
again.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;I should think not, indeed! You ought to
have stuck it into your sleeve.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;That's just what Father Clumpylump said.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;And he was quite right. And then?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Indeed! Goody Grumbles, dear, old soul!
And what had she to say?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Not much; but she gave me a knife.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;A knife! Another most useful present!
Where is it, then?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I stuck it into my sleeve, and it fell out on
the way.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Of course it did. You ought to have put it
into your pocket.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;<ins title="original has That">That's</ins> just what Goody Grumbles said.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;And she was quite right. And then?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;And then I went to see Uncle Crabstick.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Uncle Crabstick! Did he give you anything?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Yes, he gave me a lamb.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;A lamb! How delightful! Where is it,
then?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I crammed it into my pocket, and it was
stifled.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;I should think it was! Into your pocket!
Good heavens! Whoever thought of putting a
lamb into his pocket! You should have tied a
rope round its neck and led it carefully along.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;That's just what Uncle Crabstick said.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;I should think he did! And then?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Then I went to see Auntie Jumblewig.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;That was quite right. Did she give you
anything?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;She gave me a splendid ham.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;A ham! I <i>am</i> glad. That <i>will</i> come in
useful. Where is it?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I tied a rope to it, and led it carefully along
the road, but some dogs ate it up while I was not
looking.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Of course they did, you foolish boy! You
should have carried it on your head.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;That's just what Auntie Jumblewig said when
she saw me start.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Of course she did! and then?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I went to see Cousin Peter.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Cousin Peter! And what did the good man
say to you?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Not much; but he gave me a calf.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;A calf! How generous! Where is the calf
then?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I tried to carry it on my head, but he kicked
my face, so I let him go.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Serve you right! How could you be so
foolish as to carry a calf on your head? You
should have taken him to the cow-house and settled
him in a nice warm corner, with plenty of straw.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;That is just what Cousin Peter advised me
to do.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;He was quite right. And then?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I went to see Rose.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;I am glad you went there. Rose is a charming
girl. Was she well disposed towards you?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Very. Indeed, she came here with me.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Where is she, then?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I took her to the cow-house, and settled her
in a nice, warm corner, with plenty of straw.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;In the cow-house! Rose! Wretched boy!
You should have brought her into the best parlour,
and asked her to marry you.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;That's just what she said.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;And she was quite right. Quick! Quick!

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Vernon.</span>&mdash;(<i>Alone at writing table.</i>) What
a long time it is since the children have been into
the room! It must be nearly five minutes! They
don't seem to be having as many "good ideas" to-day
as they generally do. So I may as well do my
accounts. (<i>Begins to add up.</i>) Ah! there they
come.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Janet.</span>&mdash;Mammy! Mammy!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ralph.</span>&mdash;We have such a good idea.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mother.</span>&mdash;(I thought so!) What is it?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;We're going to surprise you very much.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Are you? How delightful!</p>

<p>R.&mdash;We're going to invite you to a tea party of
our very own!</p>

<p>J.&mdash;We are going to get it ready and arrange it
quite by ourselves!</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Isn't that a lovely idea?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;It is, indeed.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;And the surprise is going to be that you are
going to receive an invitation from us, just like the
real invitations you get from your friends.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;I see!</p>

<p>R.&mdash;But the thing that will surprise you most
will be that we are going to do it ourselves, won't it?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;(<i>Smiling.</i>) Yes, I must say that will be the
most surprising thing of all.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Then, first, here's the invitation.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Oh, this is most exciting. (<i>Reads.</i>) "Ralph
and Janet request the pleasure of your company at
their very own tea-party on Wednesday afternoon."</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Isn't that a surprise for you, Mammy?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;It is, indeed, most astonishing. Now I
must answer this, I suppose?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Of course you must, just as if you were
writing to strangers, you must end it "your loving
Mrs. Vernon," or something stiff of that sort.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Of course you mustn't put "your affectionate
Mother," as you do when you really write to us,
you know.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Not for worlds! Now, then, I had better
write the letter, and then do my accounts, while
you get the tea ready.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Oh, yes, that will be delightful.</p>

<blockquote>

in a low voice, looking round them helplessly</i>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>R.&mdash;(<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.) We had better ask Mammy,
I think.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Much better.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>) Mammy, there is just one thing
we want to ask you.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Yes? What is it?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Where do you think we had better have tea?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Wherever you like. What do you say to
the dining-room?</p>

<p>R.&mdash;The dining-room is so common.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;You may have it in here if you like.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Oh, that would be the very thing!</p>

<p>R.&mdash;What table shall we have it on?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;(<i>Looking round.</i>) Let me see&mdash;would that
one do?</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Oh, beautifully. Thank you so much, Mammy.</p>

<p class="revind">(<i>They pull out the table and open it, while the

<p>J.&mdash;Now, what next?</p>

<p>R.&mdash;The cloth, of course.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I wonder where we can get one.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Mammy!</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Well?</p>

<p>R.&mdash;What about a table-cloth?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Hadn't you better ask Susan for one of the
dining-room ones?</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Susan is always cross when we ask her for
that kind of thing, she seems to think we make
jam and cocoa stains on the table-cloths.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Dear me, I wonder what can make her think
that?</p>

<p>R.&mdash;I think it must be because Janet always
spills the jam at breakfast.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;You needn't talk, for once you dropped a
whole cutlet on to your knicker-bockers.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;But as we are not going to have cutlets, you
needn't talk about it now.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;I don't think people ought to quarrel when
they're giving a tea-party.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;No, we'll quarrel after tea, we're too busy
now.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Much!</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Well, what about the table-cloth, then?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;If you don't want to ask Susan I might lend
you that embroidered five o'clock tea-cloth which I
bought at the bazaar the other day.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Oh, that would be the very thing! May we
have it?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Yes, if you like, it is in that drawer.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Which drawer?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;The bottom one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="revind">(<span class="smallcaps">Ralph</span> <i>opens the top one</i>. <span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> <i>and he look

<p>R.&mdash;Mammy, we can't find it.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Are you quite sure you are looking in the
right drawer?</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Quite. You said the top drawer, didn't you?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;No. I said the bottom drawer.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Oh, I thought you said the top drawer.
(<i>They look in. To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.) I wonder where it can
be! (<i>After a moment.</i>) Mammy, I am so very
sorry&mdash;we can't find it.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;(<i>Gets up.</i>) How very odd. I saw it there
yesterday. Why, there it is just at the top, you
little noodles!</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Oh, so it is, I hadn't seen it.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Nor had I.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Thank you so much, Mammy. (<i>She goes back
to her writing. To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.) Now, we must have
our own cups and saucers out of the toy cupboard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="revind">(<i>They open the toy cupboard, and they both sit
down on the ground.</i> <span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> <i>takes out a

</blockquote>

<p>M.&mdash;(<i>Looking round.</i>) My dear children, is that
how you are laying the table?</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Oh, Mammy, I am so sorry! I forgot we
were getting out our cups and saucers. (<span class="smallcaps">Ralph</span>
<i>takes out cups and saucers and gives them to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Janet</span>.)
Here they are, three cups and three saucers.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Now I'm Susan!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="revind">(<span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> <i>arranges the cups and saucers close together
at one side of the table</i>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>R.&mdash;You stupid girl, that is not how they ought
to be arranged. Susan always put them quite
apart from each other, and the tea-pot at one end
of the table like this.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Do let me have the tea-pot in front of me.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Certainly not, it must be in front of me.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Mammy, don't you think I ought to have the
tea-pot in front of me? because I am a girl.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;No, I'll have it in front of me, because I am
a boy.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Suppose you put it in the middle of the
table where you can both reach it. I shall sit at
the side like a guest, and you can take turns.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;That will be delightful. We will put the
tea-pot here, then.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Where is the tea-pot?</p>

<p>R.&mdash;That's true, yes, we haven't got one of our
own. Mammy, what tea-pot are we to have?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Won't you have the one we always have at tea?</p>

<p>R.&mdash;No, it's too common. It won't seem like
our own tea-party, then.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I suppose we mightn't have one of the beautiful
little tea-pots out of the china cupboard, just
for once?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Just for once, you may, if you take care of it.</p>

<p class="right">(<span class="smallcaps">Ralph</span> <i>goes out</i> <span class="smallcaps">L.</span> <i>Then comes back.</i>)</p>

<p>R.&mdash;I am afraid I am not tall enough to reach
the cupboard.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;You don't think, I suppose, you could come
into the next room and get it for us?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;(<i>Getting up.</i>) I daresay I might.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;You see it is not our fault if we are not as
tall as you, is it?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Not quite, I daresay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="revind">(<i>She goes out. They watch her through the
door.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>R.&mdash;Isn't Mammy tall when she stands on a foot-stool!</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I mean to be just the same size as Mammy
is when I grow up.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;That's just like a girl, to say that sort of
stupid thing. You don't know in the least how tall
you will be when you grow up.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Well, if girls are stupid, they are not so rude
as boys.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Girls are rude sometimes. It was very rude of
you to talk about my dropping the cutlet into my lap.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;(<span class="smallcaps">Mother</span> <i>coming in with two tea-pots</i>.) You
don't mean to say you are still discussing that
cutlet! Now, which of the tea-pots is it to be?</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Oh, Mammy, I have such a good idea! Let's
have them both, one at each end, and then we can
both pour out tea.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Very well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="revind">(<i>They put tea-pots on table. They walk round
the table looking at them. The</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mother</span>
<i>goes on writing</i>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>R.&mdash;Oh, this is capital. Now, we must get the
things to eat. We shall want milk and sugar.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;And bread and butter and biscuits.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;And jam and cakes, perhaps&mdash;because, as it
is our own tea-party, it ought to be a grand one.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Of course.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;I've got some sugar that I put in my pocket
this morning for the raven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="revind">(<i>Feels in his pocket, and brings out string, knife,
etc., finally four lumps of sugar, one at a time.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>J.&mdash;Four lumps, will that be enough?</p>

<p>R.&mdash;I wonder how many Mammy will want.
Mammy, do you like your tea very, very sweet?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;No, I don't like sugar in it at all.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Oh, that's capital. Now, Janet, we can have
two lumps each, one in each cup of tea. You can't
have more. It's horrid to be greedy, you know.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;(<i>With a sigh.</i>) Well, I suppose that will have
to do.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Now, there's the milk, we'll ask the cook for
that.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;And we shall want some spoons and knives.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Susan will get out those.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I should like to have some toast, too.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;We'll ask nurse to make that, they make
such nice toast in the nursery.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;And then the biscuits.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;And the jam. We must ask Mammy what
we may have. Mammy!</p>

<p>M.&mdash;What is it now?</p>

<p>R.&mdash;We may have some biscuits and some cakes,
as well as bread and butter, mayn't we?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Oh yes, you may look in the dining-room
cupboard for what you want, if you don't take too
much.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Oh, how delightful! Come, Janet.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;(<i>Alone.</i>) Perhaps in the meantime I shall
be able to add up my accounts!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="revind">(<i>Writes intently. After a minute the children
burst in again, carrying spoons, and knives,
and plates.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>R.&mdash;Oh, Mammy, there are such a lot of things
in the dining-room cupboard, we don't know which
to choose.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I wish you would come and help us.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;I suppose you're too busy, aren't you?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Oh, I daresay I can manage it. (<i>Gets up.</i>)</p>

<p>R.&mdash;(<i>Who is laying the table.</i>) You know really,
Mammy, the best thing would be that you should
look into the dining-room cupboard, while Janet
and I finish the table; we are so very busy, you see.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;(<i>Smiling.</i>) I will go and look in the cupboard
and see what I can find. (<i>Exit Mother.</i>)</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Now, this is getting on splendidly, isn't it
Janet? Let me see, have we remembered everything?</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I think so. The cook is making the tea and
getting the milk.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Susan is cutting the bread and butter.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Nurse is making the toast.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Mammy is choosing the cakes and the jam.
I must say I do feel proud of doing it all by ourselves,
without giving anybody extra trouble.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Yes, it makes me feel as if we were such good
children.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;So it does me.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I should like to feel like this every day.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Oh, I think one would soon get tired of it,
you know. Oh, here comes Mammy! (<i>They both
run up to her as she comes in.</i>) Well, Mammy, well?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Well, you had better go into the dining-room
and see if you approve of my choice.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Oh, thank you. Now we must have some
plates to put the cakes upon.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Mammy, may we just for once have those
beautiful little plates out of the china cupboard?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Just for once then, if you take good care of
them.</p>

<p>R.&mdash;Then, Mammy, I think you had better get
them out for fear we should break them.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Very well, let's go and get them.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>She gives a hand to each.</i>)</p>

<p>J.&mdash;Oh, are you not pleased with us for arranging
our tea-party all by ourselves! (<i>They go out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. M.</span>&mdash;Hadn't you better go to the nursery
then?</p>

<p>H.&mdash;Oh no, Mammy! it's so babyish to stay in
the nursery! It's much nicer to stay in the drawing-room
by ourselves, as if we were you and Pappy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. M.</span>&mdash;Only Pappy and I don't get into mischief
when we are left in the drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. M.</span>&mdash;You are not to play with my reels of
cotton, or to throw them about.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Certainly not.</p>

books, or to drop them on the ground.</p>

<p>H.&mdash;No, we won't.</p>

that box.</p>

<p>H.&mdash;Why mustn't we touch that box?</p>

<p>H.&mdash;Oh Mammy! is it a great secret?</p>

we do?</p>

<p>P.&mdash;I think it's rather dull staying in the drawing-room.
Let's go into the nursery.</p>

<p>H.&mdash;No, that's so babyish&mdash;you talk as if we
were little children. Let us stay here, and do
exactly what Pappy and Mammy do.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Very well&mdash;I'll sit here and work, and you
sit in that chair with your legs crossed, and read
the newspaper to me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>P.&mdash;I wish I had some work to do. I wonder if
I may do some of Mammy's?</p>

<p>H.&mdash;I should think so. She didn't say anything
about her work, she only said you weren't to play
with the reels of cotton, you know.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Well, of course, I shan't do that. (<i>Takes a
piece of embroidery.</i>) Oh dear, I've unthreaded the
needle! I shall never be able to work with this
thick thread, I must get a finer reel. (<i>Gets out two
or three reels which she puts in her lap. Tries to thread
the needle.</i>)</p>

<p>H.&mdash;Now, I'll tell you what, I'll read out loud
just as Pappy does. (<i>Begins to read.</i>) "The
threatening aspect of the political outlook has
undergone no recent modification&mdash;" what on earth
does that mean?</p>

<p>P.&mdash;I don't know in the least what modication
means.</p>

<p>H.&mdash;It isn't modication, you stupid! mod-<i>i-fi</i>-cation.</p>

<p>H.&mdash;How should I know?</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Then you are as stupid as I am.</p>

quite certain. Oh yes, they are sugar plums,
there's not a doubt. (<i>They put them into the box.</i>)</p>

<p>P.&mdash;I think it's rather horrid to put them back
into the box again after we have licked them.</p>

licked, and eat them. That will be cleaner, won't
it?</p>

they are now!</p>

<p>P.&mdash;I really think that would be the safest plan.</p>

<blockquote>
 <p class="revind">(<i>Their mother comes in while they are sitting on
the floor eating the sugar plums.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. M.</span>&mdash;I've come back for my card-case which
I have forgotten. Why, what have you been
doing? Oh, Harry! Oh, Ph&oelig;be! I thought you
were going to be so good!</p>

<p>P.&mdash;So we were! We were trying to be very,
very good.</p>

<p>H.&mdash;Awfully good.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. M.</span>&mdash;Good, indeed! I told you not to play
with my work-basket, or the books, or the sofa
cushions, or that box, and you have disobeyed me
in everything! My reels are on the floor, my
books on the floor, the sofa cushion on the floor,
the box that I particularly asked you not to touch
upset and emptied! I must say I think you have
been very naughty.</p>

<p>H.&mdash;Dear Mammy, I am so sorry! We really
didn't mean to play with any of the things. We
were going to be like you and Pappy. So I began
to read the paper to Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;While I did your work.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. M.</span>&mdash;(<i>Horrified.</i>) My work!</p>

<p>H.&mdash;And, then, because I didn't understand what
we were reading about, I got a dictionary to look
out the words, and I dropped it, and Ph&oelig;be said I
was clumsy.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;So then he threw a sofa cushion at me.</p>

<p>H.&mdash;Only because she called me names, you
know. It wasn't a pillow fight in the least.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;And I jumped up, and the reels rolled off my
lap, and I tried to take the cushion away from him,
and somehow we knocked over the box.</p>

<p>H.&mdash;But we didn't mean to in the very least. It
was quite by accident.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. M.</span>&mdash;Then, how did those sugar plums get
into your mouths? That was by accident too I
suppose.</p>

<p>H.&mdash;No, that was because we thought it was so
dirty to put back the sugar plums we had licked.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;We just licked them to make sure they were
sugar plums.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. M.</span>&mdash;I see. Well, those sugar plums were
for you. Your uncle sent them, and I was going to
give them to you this evening, but now I shall
throw them away instead.</p>

<p>H.&mdash;Throw them away! Oh, Mammy, what a
pity!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs. M.</span>&mdash;Yes, it is a pity I can't trust two
children of six and seven years old in a room by
themselves. Come, let me see you safely in the
nursery before I go out again.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;It <i>is</i> a pity, just when we were trying to be
the best children in the world! (<i>They go out.</i>)</p>

<p>F.&mdash;We'll wait and see how much work he can
do, and if he doesn't succeed, Jack will have to go.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Ah, Jack, it is a great pity you're too stupid

gone, and saved your dear brother the trouble.</p>

long as one can rest. I haven't chopped much
wood yet, I thought I'd do it after luncheon. I
shall feel so much stronger then, and be able to
work twice as hard. Let me see, it must be time
to lay the table. (<i>Opens lid of hamper and looks in.</i>)
Ah, this does look good! Sausage rolls, chicken

<p>T.&mdash;Good morning, old creature.</p>

<p>G. M.&mdash;You seem to be having a picnic all by
yourself.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Yes, fortunately I am all alone. I don't like
picnics with other people.</p>

<p>G. M.&mdash;That's a pity. I was just going to ask if
I might join you.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;You!</p>

<p>G. M.&mdash;Yes, the fact is I am a long way from my
home, and I am hungry, and seeing that large
hamper I thought you might be able to spare some
food for the tired wayfarer.</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Well, I am sorry to say I can't; there
happens to be just enough for myself in that
hamper.</p>

<p>G. M.&mdash;What, can you not even spare me a crust
of bread?</p>

<p>T.&mdash;No, I shall have to eat it up all myself in
order to keep up my strength while I am cutting
wood this afternoon.</p>

<p>G. M.&mdash;(<i>Lifting up his hand and speaking in a loud,
warning tone.</i>) Take care, young man, lest your
meal and your wood-cutting come to an untimely
end. (<i>He goes away.</i>)</p>

<p>T.&mdash;Tiresome old creature! He's gone, at any-rate.
Now I can lunch in peace. (<i>Opens lid of
hamper. Starts.</i>) Oh, what has happened? Where
has everything gone? My beautiful luncheon has
disappeared! The sausage rolls have turned to
sticks! (<i>Throws out sticks, leaves, etc., as he speaks.</i>)
The salad into dead leaves! The chicken sandwiches
and jam tart into brown paper! Oh, what
an unfortunate youth I am! Now I shall have no
luncheon. It is all because of that horrid grey
man. He was an enchanter, I suppose, or a fairy
of some kind. Why didn't he say so at once?
Then I might have given him a piece of chicken.
Well, it's too late now, I suppose. Perhaps I had
better cut some wood, there's nothing else to do.
There's a tree that would be easy enough.</p>

my mother said she had nothing for me

<p>J.&mdash;On the contrary, I should like it&mdash;the more

<p>G. M.&mdash;To tell you the truth, I am very hungry.
I have been out all day, and am far from my home.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;I only wish I had some food for you more
worthy of your acceptance&mdash;but such as it is, you
are heartily welcome to it. Pray take it all. There
is not much, but what there is you are quite welcome
to have&mdash;I can wait till I get home again.</p>

<p>G. M.&mdash;Generous youth! Your kindness of heart
shall be rewarded. Look again at the contents of
your basket, and you will find them better than
you imagined.</p>

<p>J.&mdash;(<i>Looking into the basket.</i>) Oh, how exciting!
What do I see? Mutton cutlets, cold partridge,
cheese-cakes, grapes, bananas! Oh, how delightful!
Now you will share with me, won't you?</p>

some to prove you&mdash;and seeing how deserving you
are, I will reward you still further. (<i>Points off</i> <span class="smallcaps">l.</span>

<p>P.&mdash;Oh, am I not like a princess?</p>

<p>G.&mdash;You are indeed! Now, what next?</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Next, I must have a coach to go to the
ball in.</p>

<p>G.&mdash;Of course. Look out of the window, and
tell me what you see, and if there is anything we
can make a coach of.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;I'm afraid not. I can only see a pumpkin
lying on the ground, and two large brown rats behind
it, and six little mice darting in and out.</p>

<p>G.&mdash;The very thing! That will do perfectly.
Now, I am going to repeat another spell, and while
I wave my wand, you look out of the window and
tell me what happens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="revind">(<i>Repeats last two lines of spell and waves wand.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>P.&mdash;Oh, Godmother! Quick! The pumpkin
has turned into a beautiful, glass coach!</p>

<p>G.&mdash;I thought it would! (<i>Waves wand again.</i>)
Anything else?</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Yes! Yes! The two brown rats have
changed into a coachman and footman.</p>

<p>G.&mdash;(<i>Waves wand.</i>) Anything else?</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Yes! Yes! The little mice have turned
into six beautiful horses with long tails and harness
shining with silver.</p>

<p>G.&mdash;Well, will that do to drive you to the ball,
do you think?</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Oh, Godmother, how delightful! Let me get
into it and drive off!</p>

<p>G.&mdash;One moment, Cinderella! I must make a
condition before you start. You must promise not
to remain at the ball after midnight. If you are
there after the last stroke of twelve, your beautiful
silver clothes will disappear, and you will have on
your rags again.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Oh, I promise, dear Godmother. Of course
I will leave before twelve.</p>

<p>G.&mdash;Then come, Princess Cinderella! your glass
coach stops the way.</p>

out.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;My dear girls, the fact is, you are so beautiful,
and so well dressed, that people don't dare to
ask you. I am sure that is what it is.</p>

<p>L.&mdash;I saw the prince looking longingly at me a
little while ago, but just as he was going to invite
me to dance, he was called away to meet a foreign
princess.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mab.</span>&mdash;Of course, if she were a princess, he
couldn't help going to meet her. I wonder who
she was? She had on the most beautiful silver
shoes.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Here is the Court herald, passing through
the hall, ask him her name. Oh, sir! I beg your
pardon!&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">Can you tell me who the lady in silver was, who
was dancing with the prince just now?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Herald.</span>&mdash;She was announced as the Princess of
the Silver Mountain.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;The Princess of the Silver Mountain! Indeed!</p>

<p>L.&mdash;She looked like it, I am sure.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;The reason why I ask is, the prince had
been going to dance with my daughter, and he was
obliged to leave her for this lady.</p>

<p>H.&mdash;Oh, indeed!</p>

<p>L.&mdash;So, you see, I have no partner in consequence.</p>

<p>H.&mdash;What a pity!</p>

<p>M.&mdash;My girls are both passionately fond of
dancing.</p>

<p>H.&mdash;Indeed! that is a charming taste.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mab.</span>&mdash;It is not surprising we should like it, we
dance very beautifully.</p>

<p>L.&mdash;Oh, what a very rude man!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mab.</span>&mdash;I can't understand it at all. I quite
thought we should have been the belles of the ball.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Then suppose, my children, we go to the
refreshment-room and have some ices? Perhaps
we may find some partners there. (<i>Gets up.</i>)</p>

yourself, princess. (<i>They go on speaking in low voices.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mab.</span>&mdash;Did you hear her, Mother? Did you
hear those insulting words?</p>

<p>M.&mdash;Never mind, it's no good quarrelling with
princes. Come and have some strawberry ice.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>They go out.</i>)</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Now, tell me about this wonderful place
where you live, for I have not heard of it before.
The Silver Mountain! What an enchanting spot it
sounds! It must be Fairy-land!</p>

<p>C.&mdash;It is, indeed, in Fairy-land!</p>

<p>P.&mdash;I was sure of it&mdash;a fit abode for so ethereal
a being as yourself. You were nourished, I feel
sure, on no mortal food&mdash;your dainty, beautiful
clothes were woven by no mortal hands&mdash;they
were spun by elves and fairies in some enchanted,
far-away spot.</p>

<p>C.&mdash;Indeed, I believe they were.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Adorable creature! Come, tell me where
this Silver Mountain is, that I may find my way to
it over every obstacle.</p>

<p>C.&mdash;But there is the music beginning again!
We should be dancing, your highness.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;What delicious simplicity! Are you then so
fond of dancing?</p>

<p>C.&mdash;I love it, but I so seldom get a chance.</p>

<p>P.&mdash;Of course, yes, you are hedged in, I daresay,
by the etiquette of your court.</p>

<p>C.&mdash;Precisely.</p>

<p>M.&mdash;My dears, going to a ball doesn't seem to

<p>C.&mdash;I suppose it was dancing so much that tired
you?</p>

whole time, from the moment we entered the room.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mab.</span>&mdash;There were many people we were obliged
to refuse, and they were heart-broken.</p>

<p>L.&mdash;But, of course, when the prince asked us,
we were obliged to throw over the others.</p>

you a great deal, then?</p>

strange princess came, then he was obliged to leave
us.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
